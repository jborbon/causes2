Every penny of your gift today will go toward recovery efforts to help reunite pets with families, help animals turned into shelters find homes, and help Houston and Florida area rescue groups and shelters rebuild and recover.

Best Friends Animal Society is the only national animal welfare organization focused exclusively on ending the killing of dogs and cats in America’s shelters. We believe that by working together we can Save Them All.

					Monique Cavasher, 20, and Raymond Montgomery, 28, say Hurricane Katrina brought them together.

"We're just starting a relationship,'' Cavasher said. The two stood outside the center in front of the security checkpoint. They had been kissing wildly. "We met behind the shelter two days ago,'' she said.

Cavasher had arrived at the shelter two days earlier, after overstaying her welcome at a friend's house in Baton Rouge where she had been staying since the storm hit.

Montgomery, a butcher, waited out the storm with his brother, cousin, and mother in an apartment in New Orleans.

"Everything was loose, flying around," he said of the wind. "After, the floodwater came.''

His mother got a lift to Texas. He, his cousin, and his brother set out for dry ground nearby.

"We swam," he said. "Then a boat picked us up, brought us to the parish line. I trekked in water to the causeway, and a truck picked us up and brought us to Baton Rouge.''

Since arriving at the shelter, Montgomery's brother had left for Missouri. He didn't know where his cousin is. He wasn't certain where his mother was, either.

"To the best of my knowledge, she's with my stepfather and sister,'' he said.

For their part, Cavasher and Montgomery planned on staying in Baton Rouge together.

"Some good things have come out of Hurricane Katrina, and he's one of them,'' Cavasher said.

					Clearing the French Quarter

New Orleans remained mostly abandoned except for the U.S. military, which had set up base camp on the banks of the Mississippi, a stone's throw from the French Quarter.

Next to the camp was a large tent city, housing hundreds of volunteers who had come to support the military by cooking, cleaning, and clearing debris. Among them were crews of Navajo Scouts, Native American firefighters from Arizona.

"When we got here, you couldn't even walk down here, with the logs,'' said Ed Notah, leader of a crew from Fort Defiance, Arizona.

Notah's crew was one of about a dozen U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs teams who had been staying in New Orleans on 21-day rotations.

Since arriving, Notah's team had been busy clearing out the wreckage that Katrina left behind.

"We set up base camp, we sawed broken branches, cleared sidewalks,'' Notah said. "The tour has been smooth.''

The Navajo Scouts also cleaned up debris from Jackson Square Park in preparation for President George W. Bush's address there on September 15.

Chris Moore, 51, a volunteer with a faith-based group from Macon, Georgia, was also staying in the tent city.

Moore grew up in New Orleans's Seventh Ward at the base of the French Quarter, not far from the camp.

"Coming in last night, it was like going through a war zone," he said. "The streets are blocked off, there's a lot of damage to buildings. Nothing but darkness in the depth of the city where there should be lights.

"I felt funny coming back,'' he said. "But I'm glad to see so much good coming out of the darkness.''

					Cassandra Brown, 45, of New Orleans, went through much of the storm's aftermath alone.

Now reunited with her daughter, Rashonda Johnson, 31, Brown was living with about a thousand other people at the River Center, the convention center in Baton Rouge where the Red Cross had set up a shelter.

The Sunday that Katrina struck, Brown and her family took shelter at their church in New Orleans. They planned to leave the city together the next day.

"My son picked me up at the church and he dropped me off at my apartment,'' she said. Her son couldn't make it back to pick her up; neither could her daughter.

"I got stuck there until Wednesday morning,'' Brown said. She had no food, electricity, or water.

"I took the time to fast and pray,'' she said.

In time a man with a boat came to take people out of the apartment complex, but he left Brown and several others behind. "He made just three trips,'' she said.

"By Wednesday, the water was up to my chin,'' Brown said. "[But] I made up my mind to walk to safety."

She found a bus that took her to New Orleans' convention center. But there she found little comfort.

"I saw people dropping dead, people getting beat up. I saw it all. I saw it all," she said. "I stayed on the sidewalk of the convention center so I could be in the open.''

Eventually Brown took a bus to a Howard Johnson's motel in Shreveport, where she called her daughter, who was at the River Center shelter. Brown took a bus to the shelter to be with her.

"From this point on, where she goes, I go,'' Brown said.

					The calm before the storm was much too calm, which should have been a clue. Forecasters had been talking about a potential Halloween hurricane—the Frankenstorm was its ­headline-ready name—for two weeks. They thought it might be bigger than the hurricane of 1938; its barometric pressure was already a few ticks lower. The twist about this one, endlessly dissected, was that it was actually going to be two storms: Sandy would head north and encounter another weather system coming down from the northeast, a bank shot that would send the storm directly at New Jersey and a surge straight into the harbor, which is a natural funnel—New York’s own perfect storm.

The subway was shut down early on Sunday night, more than 24 hours before expected landfall, and Mayor Bloomberg, a reborn weather alarmist after the 2010 blizzard, canceled school and told people to read a good book. Monday felt like Sunday on Seconal. For entertainment, we had breathless newscasters standing in puddles in their wet-weather gear, heralding the Storm of the Century that no one believed would really happen. “What preparations are you making?” asked an out-of-towner. “We have a lot of tea lights!” said the New Yorker, suggesting that anything more might be overkill. Outside, there was a gusting breeze, pulsing sheets of blowing spray. Inside was a flashlight, maybe some tuna and sardines, a disaster pantry left over, unused, from Irene.

And then it started. It hit New York first out in the boroughs, a fourteen-foot surge pushing into the swampy lowlands of Staten Island, floating houses off their foundations, flooding people’s cars before they realized they were in danger. At Breezy Point, a fire had started at seven with the tide rising. In Red Hook, the water had crested the bank that afternoon, making no exceptions, swamping the housing projects and the Fairway and the artisans’ studios with six feet of water.

Finally, Manhattan itself began to be submerged. Water poured over the esplanades that are one of Bloomberg’s most impressive legacies, swamping bodegas on the East Side, lapping the High Line on the West Side. At ground zero, 30 feet of water poured into the famous bathtub—submerging our last disaster. But that was only the beginning. Because then, the lights went out.
